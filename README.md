# FREE DevOps for Beginners Cohort with Pravin Mishra – Week 2: Learning Git & GitHub  

When I look back at my journey into tech, I can honestly say it hasn’t been easy. Coming from a background with no IT knowledge, every step has been a challenge — but also a breakthrough. Many times I felt stuck, but I kept pushing, knowing that perseverance is the only way forward.  

That is why I feel deeply grateful to have been selected for the **FREE DevOps for Beginners Cohort with Pravin Mishra**. To spend **eight hours on a Saturday Zoom session** learning Git and GitHub under his guidance felt like a gift. Mr Pravin is not only one of the best in the business, but also a rare kind of teacher: he doesn’t just explain concepts, he empowers you to **execute them with confidence**. His Udemy course is the foundation of our learning, and the way he breaks things down makes even complex topics feel achievable.  

This week, our session focused on **Git and GitHub** — two tools that are absolutely essential for every developer and DevOps engineer.

## What is Git?  
Git is a **distributed version control system** that allows developers to:  
- Track changes in code over time.  
- Work on separate **branches** without disturbing the main project.  
- **Merge** changes back together once features are tested.  
- Maintain a complete history of every change.  

In simple terms, Git makes teamwork possible. Instead of overwriting each other’s work, we can collaborate smoothly and safely.  

---

## What is GitHub?  
GitHub is a **platform built on top of Git**. Think of Git as the engine, and GitHub as the car that makes it driveable. GitHub provides:  
- A **cloud-based hosting service** for Git repositories.  
- Collaboration features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.  
- Integrations with CI/CD pipelines, making it vital in the DevOps world.

## Git vs GitHub – The Difference  
- **Git** = the tool installed on your computer to track and manage code.  
- **GitHub** = an online service where Git repositories are stored, shared, and collaborated on.  

They complement each other: Git handles version control locally, while GitHub connects people across the world.

## What I Learned About Git & GitHub  

During this session, I learned **step by step** how to get started with Git and GitHub. Here are the key highlights:  

### Installing Git  
- **On Linux**: `sudo apt-get install git`  
- **On Windows**: Download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the setup.  
- **Git Bash for Windows**: Provides a Linux-like terminal experience on Windows.  

### Git Configuration  
- Setting your identity:  
  - `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`  
  - `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`  
- Local repository configuration.  
- Checking settings: `git config --list`  

### Initializing a Git Repository  
- Create a folder → `git init`  
- This command creates a hidden `.git` folder which stores all repository data.  

### Types of Git Repositories  
- **Local Repository** → on your own machine.  
- **Remote Repository** → hosted on GitHub for collaboration.  

### Git Commands I Practiced  
- `git init` → initialize a repository.  
- `git status` → check the state of the repo.  
- `git add .` → stage all changes.  
- `git commit -m "message"` → save changes with a message.  
- `git log` → view history.  
- `git push` → send changes to GitHub.  
- `git pull` → fetch and merge changes from GitHub.  

### GitHub Commands / Features  
- Creating a repository on GitHub.  
- Connecting local repo to GitHub (`git remote add origin`).  
- **Authentication**: HTTPS and SSH methods.  
- Pull requests, merges, and collaboration workflows.  

### Code Tracking & .gitignore  
- Git tracks changes in files.  
- `.gitignore` tells Git which files/folders **not** to track (e.g., API keys, configs).  
- Example:  
  ```bash
  touch .gitignore

## Git with VS Code  

Working with Git directly in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** makes version control even easier:  

- VS Code has a built-in **Source Control panel** for staging, committing, and pushing changes.  
- You can switch **branches** or create new ones without leaving the editor.  
- Extensions like **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** allow you to manage collaboration directly inside VS Code.

## Why Git & GitHub Matter in DevOps  

Git and GitHub are not just tools for developers — they are at the heart of DevOps practices:  

- **Version Control** → No work is ever lost, and every change is tracked.  
- **Branching & Merging** → Experiment safely without breaking the main project.  
- **Collaboration** → Enables teamwork across the world, in real time.  
- **Code Reviews** → Encourage quality and shared learning.  
- **CI/CD Integration** → GitHub repositories connect directly with pipelines, deployments, and automation.  

Without Git and GitHub, modern DevOps workflows would simply not exist.

## Reflection  

This week’s session was a turning point for me.  

I went from struggling to understand Git to actually **using commands, pushing code, and connecting with GitHub**. I learned not only the technical aspects but also the **why** — why version control matters, why GitHub is essential for collaboration, and how these tools fit into the bigger DevOps journey. 
This week’s session was packed with knowledge. From installing Git, configuring it, learning commands, understanding GitHub, authentication, and even VS Code integration — every moment felt like a step forward in becoming a better DevOps practitioner.

I’m humbled and grateful for the opportunity to learn from Praveen Mishra and our co-mentors, the support and commitment they show us is very humbling. His patience, clarity, and gift for teaching inspire me to push harder, knowing that growth is possible with the right guidance.

The fact that there is even a full session recording available on YouTube https://lnkd.in/gfv6RJRa shows how much value he gives to his students.


I understand see the bigger picture of how tools like Git and GitHub shape the future of software development and DevOps.

I’m excited to continue this journey, and I can’t wait to discover what we’ll be diving into next week.

I feel grateful for this opportunity to learn under **Pravin Mishra**, whose gift for teaching makes complex ideas simple and actionable. He doesn’t just teach concepts he gives you the confidence to execute them.  

This is only **Week 2** of the cohort, and I’m already excited about what’s coming next. If Git and GitHub were this powerful to learn, I can’t wait to see what we’ll discover in Week 3.
