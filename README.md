# üåç My DevOps Week 2 Journey  
## FREE DevOps for Beginners Cohort with Praveen Mishra üöÄ  

This Saturday, I joined an **eight-hour DevOps session** on Zoom with *Praveen Mishra* as part of the **FREE DevOps for Beginners Cohort** on Udemy.  

It was long, intense, but extremely rewarding. We focused on **Git** and **GitHub**, two tools that form the backbone of modern software development and DevOps practices.  

As someone without an IT background, I used to hear ‚ÄúGit‚Äù and ‚ÄúGitHub‚Äù and think they were the same thing. But after this week‚Äôs lesson, I can clearly see their differences and how they connect.

## üîë Understanding Git vs GitHub  

### ![Git Logo](https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.png) **What is Git?**  
- Git is a **distributed version control system**.  
- It allows developers to **track changes in code**, revert to earlier versions, and work in parallel through **branching and merging**.  
- Think of it as a **time machine for code** stored on your computer.  

### ![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png) **What is GitHub?**  
- GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** where Git repositories can be stored and shared.  
- It enables **collaboration**, code reviews, and contributions from developers worldwide.  
- Think of it as the **social network for Git projects**.  

### **Key Difference**  
- **Git** = the tool (runs locally on your machine).  
- **GitHub** = the service (hosts repos online for collaboration).  

### **How They Relate**  
- You use **Git** to manage your project history locally.  
- You use **GitHub** to upload/share that project so others can collaborate with you.  
- Together, they make teamwork and DevOps practices possible.

## üåü Why Git & GitHub Are Important  
- **Version Control** ‚Üí Track changes, roll back when necessary.  
- **Branching** ‚Üí Work on features independently.  
- **Merging** ‚Üí Bring features back together.  
- **Code Tracking** ‚Üí See who did what and when.  
- **Collaboration** ‚Üí Multiple people, one project, no chaos.  
- **Integration** ‚Üí Work easily with editors like **VS Code**.  
- **Authentication** ‚Üí Secure your repos with **HTTPS** or **SSH**.  

> üí° **Key Insight:** Git is the tool, GitHub is the platform.

## üñ•Ô∏è My Practical Learning This Week  

### 1. **Installing Git**  
- On **Linux** ‚Üí  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install git



On Windows ‚Üí Download and install Git for Windows
On Git Bash (Windows) ‚Üí Simulates Linux commands for Git use


2. 

Repositories (Repos)


Definition ‚Üí A repository is a project folder managed by Git
Types:
Local Repo ‚Üí On your machine
Remote Repo ‚Üí On GitHub
Bare Repo ‚Üí For collaboration, without working directory
Creating a Repo ‚Üí

Bash

git init

3. 

Git Commands I Practiced

Bash

# Initialize Repo

git init  



# Check Repo Status

git status  



# Configure Identity

git config --global user.name "Your Name"

git config --global user.email "your@email.com"  



# Add File to Staging

git add filename  



# Commit Changes

git commit -m "message"  



# Push to GitHub

git push origin main  



# Clone Repo

git clone <URL>  



# Check History

git log

4. 

GitHub Usage & Commands


Create repositories online
Connect local repos using HTTPS/SSH
Push & pull changes between local and remote repos


5. 

Git Ignore (.gitignore)


Used to exclude files/folders from version control (e.g., API keys, config files)
Command ‚Üí
Bash

touch .gitignore

Keeps the repo clean and secure

6. 

Git & VS Code





Git in VS Code ‚Üí Commit, branch, and push directly in the editor
GitHub in VS Code ‚Üí Connect remote repos seamlessly


üé• Resources & Gratitude


Eight hours on Zoom is not easy, but this lesson was worth it.



For anyone who missed it, there is a full recording available on YouTube that explains everything from basics to hands-on practice.

I‚Äôm thankful to Praveen Mishra for his patience and clear teaching style. He not only showed us the commands but also explained the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each step.



‚ú® Final Reflection

Learning Git and GitHub felt overwhelming at first, but this week, I realized they are not just tools ‚Äî they are the foundation of teamwork in tech.

I now know how to:


Install Git on Linux and Windows
Create, configure, and manage repositories
Track code, branch, and merge safely
Use GitHub for collaboration
Keep my projects secure with .gitignore
Work with Git inside VS Code


Every command I type is a step forward in my journey. Even though I don‚Äôt come from an IT background, I‚Äôm eager to keep learning and growing.


This is only Week 2 of my DevOps journey, and I‚Äôm humbled by how much I‚Äôve already learned. The road ahead is long, but I‚Äôm fully committed.  I am eager, disciplined, and ready to learn. My journey has just begun, but I am already building the skills that matter in today‚Äôs tech world.
